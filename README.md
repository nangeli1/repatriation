Repatriating species when threats still exist

Angeli NF, Fitzgerald LA.

A complex conservation challenge is how to repatriate extirpated species when persistent threats still exist in historic ranges. Presuming that areas may never again be habitable may overlooking how dynamic landscapes have reset the stage for recovery of species. On St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, the St. Croix ground lizard (Pholidoscelis polops) was extirpated by predation of small Indian mongoose (Herpestes auropunctatus) in synergy with conversion of habitat for agriculture from the main island and is currently restricted to offshore cays. Large-scale agriculture ended by the 1950s, and historic land cover types re-emerged. We predicted suitable repatriation sites existed by integrating historic maps, on-going predator control, and mechanistic land cover models based on extant lizard physiology. Reconfigured landscapes contain patches of habitat with relatively low levels of threat. We suggest there is great potential for repatriating native species when the current landscape of threats that drove extinctions is considered.
